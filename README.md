# Diabetes Prediction System using KNN

This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes. It uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm and a healthcare dataset to provide predictions based on user input.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to assist in the early detection of diabetes by analyzing basic health parameters. Users can input features such as:

- Glucose level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Insulin Level
- Skin Thickness
- Pregnancies

The trained model then classifies the user as either **Diabetic** or **Non-Diabetic**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if used)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained using the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which is commonly used for binary classification problems in healthcare.

- Source: [Kaggle - PIMA Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**

- A supervised learning algorithm used for classification.
- It predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class among its *k* nearest neighbors in the training data.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-knn.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-knn
````

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:

   ```bash
   python diabetes_knn.py
   ```

4. (Optional) If using Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📈 Output

The system will print whether the user is **likely diabetic** or **not diabetic** based on their input values.

Let me know if you want to include screenshots, Jupyter Notebook support, GUI interface (if added), or hosting (like Streamlit). I can update accordingly.
